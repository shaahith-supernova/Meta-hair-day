# Meta-hair-day-project
I created a simple home page for a fictional client, Hair Day. This project is done in order to complete a peer-reviewed, graded assignment in Meta's "HTML and CSS in Depth" course offered through Coursera.

The project helped me to complete the course successfully and get the course certificate. You can view the accomplishment at the following URL:
